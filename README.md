# debbug_gaming

School project.

TFE made during my Webdeveloper formation at IPEFA (Institut Provincial d'Enseignement et de Formation pour Adultes).

The idea of this site is to repertoriate bugs in video games, along with solutions to solve them (when they exists). Any user can add a bug, but it will be reviewed by an admin or a moderator before being visible in public.
